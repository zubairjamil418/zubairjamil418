  <em>Senior Full-Stack Developer | Building stable and scalable web products</em>
</p>

<br/>

<p>
  I work as a senior developer with real experience in designing and building full-stack web systems. 
  My daily work covers JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, 
  and cloud setups such as AWS. I focus on clean structure, maintainable code, and stable performance.
</p>

<p>
  I have led core features from planning to deployment in remote teams. 
  My work includes API design, database architecture, system integrations, 
  performance tuning, and practical problem solving for real products.
</p>

<p>
  My approach stays simple.  
  I study the problem, shape a clear path, and move forward with steady progress.  
  I enjoy long-term collaboration and structured project management with clear communication.

  <em>Senior Full-Stack Developer | Product-Focused Builder | Scalable Systems</em>
</p>

<br/>

<p>
  I work as a senior developer with solid experience in building stable and scalable products. 
  My work covers JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, Express, Python, PHP, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, 
  MySQL, and cloud setups such as AWS. I focus on clean structure, maintainable code, and stable performance.
</p>

<p>
  I have worked on long-term products with complete ownership. 
  This includes planning features, shaping product direction, writing functional requirements, 
  and breaking down releases into clear development cycles. 
  I use structured communication and steady delivery habits when working with remote teams.
</p>

<p>
  My technical work includes API design, database architecture, performance improvements, 
  system integrations, and scalable backend logic. 
  My product-focused work includes workflow mapping, understanding user cases, 
  and guiding development based on actual value instead of guesswork.
